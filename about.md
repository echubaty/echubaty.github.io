Hi, My name is Eric Chubaty! I'm currently situated in the Vancouver, BC region and employed for a rainforest company as a Software Development Engineer since 2019. I graduated in June 2019 from the University of Manitoba with a Bachelors in Computer Science (Honours) and a minor in mathematics. In my spare time I enjoy to stay active, make espresso, play boardgames, and learn more about topics that interest me. I currently have an interest in cybersecurity and have been participating in some CTF or TryHackMe challenges. I look forward to further developing these skills to eventually pivot into the industry in either a development or analyst role.
