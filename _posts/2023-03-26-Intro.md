Welp it's pretty empty here. What is this blog for? Well honestly I'm not too sure, but I intend to keep this as a place to document personal findings or research related to cybsersecurity. I had started on some reverse engineering of an IoT lamp based on an ESP32 which I had done some analysis in wireshark on to see the MQTT request which I plan to further analyze and hopefully be able to craft my own packets to the server. The main issue I ran into was that the server required a certificate to send so I'll see if I'm able to dump the firmware and possibly extract the cerificate from the device. Perhaps I'll get around to documenting this as a post some other day. For now the audience of this blog is myself but hoping others may eventually find this somewhat interesting as more content is added. In the mean time you can catch me on TryHackMe.
